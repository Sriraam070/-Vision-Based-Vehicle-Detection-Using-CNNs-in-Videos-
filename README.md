# Vehicle Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting vehicles in a video stream using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The pipeline leverages the power of Python, OpenCV, and machine learning classifiers to identify and draw bounding boxes around vehicles in each frame of a video.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Vehicle Detection**: Identify vehicles in a video feed using computer vision techniques.
- **Bounding Box Drawing**: Draw bounding boxes around detected vehicles.
- **False Positive Reduction**: Implement techniques to reduce false positives using heatmaps and thresholding.
- **Video Processing**: Process entire videos to demonstrate continuous vehicle detection.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- SciPy
- MoviePy (for video processing)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for development and visualization)

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and directories:

- **`vehicle_detection.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the main implementation and visualization.
- **`find_cars.py`**: Python script containing the vehicle detection algorithm (`find_cars` function).
- **`project_video.mp4`**: Input video file for testing vehicle detection.
- **`project_video_output.mp4`**: Output video file showing vehicle detection results.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation file.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Install Python dependencies (`opencv-python`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `moviepy`) using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy scipy moviepy
   ```

2. **Run the Project**: Execute the `main()` function in `find_cars.py` to process the video and generate output:
   ```bash
   python find_cars.py
   ```

3. **View Results**: The processed video (`project_video_output.mp4`) will be saved in the project directory.

## Implementation Details

### `find_cars.py`

- **`find_cars()` Function**: Implements vehicle detection using:
  - **Sliding Window Search**: Searches for vehicles across different scales and regions of interest in the video frames.
  - **Feature Extraction**: Uses Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), color histograms, and spatial binning to create feature vectors for each window.
  - **Classification**: Applies a trained SVM classifier (`svc`) to classify each window as containing a vehicle or not.

- **Heatmap Processing**: Uses heatmaps to accumulate and average detections across multiple frames to reduce false positives.

- **Video Processing**: Integrates with `moviepy` to process each frame of the input video, apply vehicle detection, and output the annotated video.

### Additional Notes

- **Performance**: Adjust parameters (`scale`, `threshold`, etc.) based on video characteristics and performance requirements.
- **Improvements**: Experiment with different classifiers, feature sets, and preprocessing techniques for better accuracy and speed.
